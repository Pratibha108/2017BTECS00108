It's deep learning project used to classify the defects from various images. Images were collected from NEU database and images was
contained six types of defect. The goal is to find an image category either it was a defect or not using Convolutional
Neural Network. Then, if image class was detected as a defect then the model was able to find the defect class with probability
and whether the defect is found or not.
